Hi Foxes! 

This is where we got to today (January 20th) in Jo's Cohort. We covered:
- Mobile-First Design
- Responsive Web Design
- Interactivity (::hover!)
- [Shapes](https://css-tricks.com/the-shapes-of-css/)
- [Block vs Inline](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/css-display-inline-vs-inline-block)

--and if you're curious as to how this Readme file was made, please feel free to review [this Markdown Sheatsheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) that I always use for these write ups!
